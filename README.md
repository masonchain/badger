# Key management solutions for DAOs

Web3 organizations lack key-lock token systems and cannot access the full suite of tooling features available in the broader ecosystem.

Badger allows you to issue Badges representing tiered access gates within your organization. By representing these permission levels with NFTs, the organization can immediately integrate with the entire suite of on-chain organization tooling available in the broader ecosystem.

Through an un-opinionated protocol that enables Organization Owners to define, issue, and revoke Badges with the ability to elect Delegates that can manage Badges, it is dead simple to manage your team on-chain using the tool stack that your organization most prefers.

Badger provides the solution. However, the protocol does not enforce how you must use it. This enables a broader range of primitive-level features to be offered without negative impact.
Badger gives flexible control over how organization policies are deployed and managed.
